He is later rescued by Haley (who went to see him after Carrie called pretending to be a nurse saying Dan was about to die) and Deb (who came afterward to help Haley and Jamie after realizing where Haley had really gone). He shoots Carrie, and she is believed to be dead. When Jamie finds out what he did, he at first stops talking to Dan. Dan leaves Tree Hill to die because he does not think he will be able to find a new heart since one became available while he was being held hostage and he lost out on it. In the year time gap between Seasons 6 and 7, Dan marries Rachel, who takes him to Mexico and illegally buys a heart. After realizing the type of person Rachel is when she wants to take their TV show to the corridor where he murdered Keith, he gives all his money to charity and divorces her. Before leaving Tree Hill once again, he says goodbye to Jamie, who tells him he forgives him. He is seen working in a burger joint, where he is visited by Quinn for help with murdering Katie, but he ends up talking her out of it. He appears shortly in the Season 8 finale when Nathan gives him a photograph of Lydia and a baseball that Jamie hit in a game. Dan returns in Season 9 because he loses everything when his diner burns down. He convinces Haley to let him stay with them for a few days, saying he has nowhere else to go. A flash-forward sequence shows Dan with Chris Keller, burning down a house and apparently ready to kill someone. When Nathan is kidnapped, Haley seeks help from Dan, who promises her that he will do whatever it takes to bring him back home. Eventually, Dan finds him and he ends up taking a bullet meant for Nathan, which critically wounds him. At the hospital, Haley tells Dan that Lucas refuses to come see him. Dan says he is okay with that because he cannot blame Lucas for not being there in his final moments when he was not there for Lucas his whole life. Dan also makes peace with Haley by saying he is glad he was proven wrong about Haley not being good enough for Nathan because she is the best thing that ever happened to him and apologizes for Keith's murder since Keith also meant a lot to her. Haley lets him hold Lydia and tells Dan that whenever Lydia asks about him, she and Nathan will tell her that he loved her and Jamie very much. Dan also makes amends with Deb and lastly, Nathan (in which Dan has a dream that he and Nathan play basketball just for fun for the first time ever), to which Nathan says that despite all the bad he did, he is still his father and forgives him. Dan dies moments later. He is visited by the ghost of Keith, who tells him that he is proud of him for finally learning to put family and friends first and become the brother he always wanted. As the two enter the afterlife, Dan asks Keith, \"I know where you're going. But what about me?\" Keith answers, \"Don't worry, little brother. You're my plus one.\"\n",

Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the \"how\" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.
