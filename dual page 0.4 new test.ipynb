      "Text: For its coverage of the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As'ad AbuKhalil) have claimed that it is pro-Israel.[265][266] The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel.[267] In 2009, the Simon Wiesenthal Center criticized the newspaper for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were described as \"hideously anti-Semitic\".[268]\n",

      "Title: [[2007 Arab League summit]]\n",
      "Text: The power struggle in Palestine will, consequently, make it impossible to implement any security understandings reached in the past or future between Israel and Abbas. The official statement from the Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesman said, \"Israel is sincerely interested in pursuing a dialogue with those Arab states that desire peace with Israel, this in order to promote a process of normalization and cooperation. Israel hopes that the Riyadh Summit will contribute to this effort.\"[10] Furthermore, the Israeli spokesman explained, \"Israel also believes that moderate Arab states can fill a positive role by encouraging regional cooperation, and supporting the Israeliâ€“Palestinian track. A dialogue between these states and Israel can contribute to this end.\"[citation needed] Many Israelis were disenchanted, however, especially when remembering the results of previous Arab League summits and the current Hamas-dominated Palestinian leadership.[11] The hope, however, is that the political partnership with Fatah will move Hamas closer to the center of Palestinian politics. Moreover, the revival of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative is clearly a product of inter-Arab politics that reflects hope for a peaceful conclusion to the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict.\n",

      "Title: [[Jordanâ€“United States relations]]\n",
      "Text: On 29 April 2023, a United States bipartisan Congressional Delegation led by Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy visited Jordan and met with King Abdullah and Crown Prince Hussein.[13][14] McCarthy stated he chose Jordan as the first country to visit as Speaker of the House because Jordan is \"a strategic ally in the Middle East and share[s] Americaâ€™s commitment to peace, prosperity â€“ and most importantly â€“ stability in the region.\"[13][15] The historic friendship and means to increase cooperation between the countries were discussed in the meeting. King Abdullah expressed his gratitude for the United States' support of Jordan and highlighted the necessity for further efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He put emphasis on the two-state solution which would result in an independent Palestinian State on the 1967 state lines with East Jerusalem as the capital.[16][17]\n",

      "Title: [[Bill Maher]]\n",
      "Text: On the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict, Maher says he is \"more on the side of the Israelis\" and does not consider both sides equally guilty. He acknowledges that \"Palestinians do have gripes\", and he has been critical of U.S. financial aid to Israel, saying \"they don't need our money, they can handle it themselves.\" Maher also notes that most Israelis would prefer a two-state solution and oppose the hard-line stance of their Israeli government, which he describes as having been taken over by their version of the Tea Party. However, Maher has defended Israel's military actions against Palestinian militants amid criticism over civilian deaths and disproportionate casualty count between Israelis and Palestinians during the 2014 Gaza war. He argues that Israel is still showing restraint, and he finds it ironic that the same people who were incredulous over how the Jews in World War II were led \"to their slaughter\", can not understand why they are defending themselves now.[98][115] Maher faced online backlash for tweeting that \"Dealing w/ Hamas is like dealing w/ a crazy woman who's trying to kill u - u can only hold her wrists so long before you have to slap her\" at the start of the war.[116] In August 2019, Maher denounced the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, saying: \"It's predicated on this notion ... I think it's very shallow thinking that the Jews in Israel are mostly white and Palestinians are mostly brown, so they must be innocent and correct and the Jews must be wrong.\"[117] He responded to Rep. Rashida Tlaib's call to boycott his talk show: \"Some people have one move only: boycott. Cancel. Make-go-away. But here's the thing, the house voted 318 to 17 to condemn the #BDS movement, including 93% of Dems. Does Tlaib want to boycott 93% of her own party?\".[118]\n",

On 27 September, the 10-month settlement freeze ended, and the Israeli government approved new construction in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.[124] On retiring from office in July 2011, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had said that Netanyahu was ungrateful to the United States and endangering Israel. Responding, the Likud party defended Netanyahu by saying that most Israelis supported the Prime Minister and that he had broad support in the United States.[125][126]\n",

Despite the constant security threats, Israelâ€”a majorly Jewish stateâ€”has thrived economically. Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s there were numerous liberalization measures: in monetary policy, in domestic capital markets, and in various instruments of governmental interference in economic activity. The role of government in the economy was considerably decreased. On the other hand, some governmental economic functions were increased: a national health insurance system was introduced, though private health providers continued to provide health services within the national system. Social welfare payments, such as unemployment benefits, child allowances, old age pensions and minimum income support, were expanded continuously, until they formed a major budgetary expenditure. These transfer payments compensated, to a large extent, for the continuous growth of income inequality, which had moved Israel from among the developed countries with the least income inequality to those with the most.\n",

During the war, the Balfour Declaration declared British support for Zionism, a political movement for establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. Zionism would come in to conflict with Palestinian nationalism, beginning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty was supportive of the Palestinians in the conflict. The Palestinian Revolt in 1936 was supported by the Egyptian Islamist political party, the Muslim Brotherhood, with Muslim Brotherhood members aiding the Palestinian Fedayeen.[2] Egypt would also join the Arab League invasion of Israel in 1948, capturing Gaza. While the West Bank was annexed by Jordan, Egypt instead created the All-Palestine Protectorate in Gaza, which claimed authority over all of Palestine and was ruled by the All-Palestine Government. Egyptian authorities would keep close political control over Gaza.[3]\n",

(Hamas had won a majority of seats in the Palestinian National Authority Legislative Council). Prior to the meeting, in an interview on February 10, 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Kommersant journalist Andrey Kolesnikov and a Spanish parliament member, said that he does not consider Hamas a terrorist organization.[13] This is despite Hamasâ€™ charter emphasizing jihad. During the talks in March 2006, Lavrov called on Hamas to comply with the earlier commitments signed by the PLO, and he reiterated those requirements. Hamas promised to respect \"the authority and competencies\" of Abbas.[14] In an interview in the Austrian daily Kurier, senior Hamas official Aziz Dweik answered on the question if a two-state solution was feasible: \"If Israel changes its attitudes toward Palestinians, if it does so much as soften its occupation practice, everything would change. Israel has to do the first step.\"[14] On March 7, 2006 Russia expressed hope that Hamas would consider supporting the Roadmap for peace and the peace plan proposed by Saudi Arabia.\"[15] The invitation and the talks caused controversy regarding Russia changing its views towards the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict. This was questioned by commentators in the United States especially among the neoconservatives.[citation needed]\n",
