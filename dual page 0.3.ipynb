      " Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader, published in 1965, is a book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety. It relates to the first models of the Chevrolet Corvair (1960–1964) that had a swing axle suspension design that was prone to 'tuck under' in certain circumstances. To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar) as a cost-cutting measure, Corvairs required tire pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer.[328] \n",

Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of habituation, or classical conditioning, operant conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals.[9][10] Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event cannot be avoided or escaped may result in a condition called learned helplessness.[11] There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally, in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation, indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development.[12] \n",

In 1903, the fraternity moved to its present location, and in 1927 it sold off its eighteenth-century house and built the house that stands today.  In 1968, the house dissociated from the national fraternity, and adopted the name Chi Phi Heorot.[14]  The \"Heorot\" in Chi Phi Heorot comes from the medieval poem Beowulf, in which Heorot is the great hall where warriors converge to tell their stories.  After several suspensions by the college in the early 1980s, it re-joined the Chi Phi national in 1981.  This was short-lived; in 1987, because of damage done to the house that the college insisted upon having repaired for safety reasons but the Chi Phi national refused to help finance, the Dartmouth brotherhood again opted to become a local fraternity.  In exchange for financing renovations to the structure, the college assumed ownership of the property and house.  In its second incarnation as a local fraternity, the brotherhood chose the name Chi Heorot.[56] Notable alumni include Gerry Geran '18, Adam Nelson '97, and Andrew Weibrecht '09, all Olympic medalists.[57] \n",

In 2003, it took eight workers three weeks to accomplish the massive decorating task.  The tree also snapped in 1974, the year before Federated bought Rich's from the Rich family.  In 2011, the tree from Douglasville cracked when being lifted off the flatbed truck, after being picked in the first contest to select the tree.

The ASRS collects, analyzes, and responds to voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident reports in order to reduce the likelihood of aviation accidents.[1] The ASRS was designed and is operated by NASA, who is seen as a neutral third-party due to its lack of enforcement authority and relations with airlines. The confidential and independent nature of the ASRS is key to its long-term success in identifying numerous latent system hazards in the National Airspace System (NAS). The FAA extends limited immunity to individual aviation workers for reporting safety events which do not result in an accident, as defined by the FAA. This has the effect of encouraging these potential reporters to come forward with systemic safety issues without fear of reprisal. The success of the system stands as a positive example used as a model by other industries seeking to make improvements in safety. Other industries who have modeled similar systems on the ASRS include the rail, medical, firefighters, and off-shore petroleum production. \n",

Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors are more likely to have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents.[157] Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career,[158] and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water.[159] Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident.[144][158][160][161][162] The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.[143] \n",

The use of a harness also allows a rider to ride for a longer time, as much of the force of the kite is taken off the rider's arms. For de-powerable kites, the harness connection is used to power and de-power the kite. There are different types of harnesses (e.g., waist or seat), and selection depends on the personal preference of the rider. Some riders use specially designed snowkiting harnesses that are very similar to those used in rock climbing (or just reuse rock climbing harnesses). Because harnesses keep the rider attached to the kite, a number of safety measures have been developed. These include easily reachable safety systems actuated by pins. The pins allow the rider to release the connection between the rider and the kite when necessary. Some harnesses also have an easily accessible knife to cut the lines if necessary in an emergency. \n",

      " Natural selection has played an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, and anything else that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins in such a way that the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.[29] \n",

As the drum would spin, the single person cars would follow the track and eventually begin to go upside down.[2] The drum steadily increased its speed and the cars would let it roll beneath their wheels as they followed the track. The cars' brakes were then applied causing them to quickly accelerate up to the speed of the drum's surface, around 30 mph (48 km/h). The operator of Flying Cars would spin the drum for two minutes and then release the brakes causing the cars to come to a complete stop while the drum slowed to a halt.[2] In 1966, the four car ride overturned on the first embankment, seriously injuring several riders.[citation needed] There was also a fatality when someone failed to properly fasten their safety belt and was killed after falling out.[1] The attraction was shut down due to safety concerns.[1] \n",

Dither fish are typically fish that swim around the top of a tank, a behavior that reassures more timid fish that no predators are nearby, and are found naturally in the same habitat as the other fish in the aquarium, thereby encouraging them to relax and engage in normal behaviour. This technique relies on the ability of cichlids in an aquarium to gauge environmental security by observing the behaviour of other fish species.[4] \n",

The proposition was made with a view to safeguarding the national self-respect of Dravidians threatened by Indo-Aryan culture, language, political leadership, and business interests. A separatist conference was held in June 1940 at Kanchipuram when Ramasamy released the map of the proposed Dravida Nadu. With the promised grant of full self-government after World War II, and posed another threat to the Indian Freedom Movement However, it failed to get British approval. On the contrary, Ramasamy received sympathy and support from people such as Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah for his views on the Congress, and for his opposition to Hindi. They then decided to convene a movement to resist the Congress.[23][24] By the 1940s, E.V.Ramasamy supported Muslim League's claim for a separate Pakistan, and expected its support in return.[25] In an interview with the Governor of Madras, Jinnah, the main leader of Muslim League, said that India should be divided into four regions: Dravidistan, Hindustan, Bangalistan and Pakistan; Dravidistan would approximately consist of the area under the Madras Presidency.[26] Jinnah stated \"I have every sympathy and shall do all to help, and you establish Dravidistan where the 7 per cent Muslim population will stretch its hands of friendship and live with you on lines of security, justice and fairplay.\"[27] \n",

Another way to light fireworks is by using a device called a punk. A punk is a long, thin piece of wood covered in a substance that burns very slowly, producing only heat, with no flame. A port fire is a smoldering compound as a powder compressed in a stiff paper tube. The most complicated method used to ignite consumer fireworks is to use electronic ignition.

Among laypersons, the term \"accidental injury\" is often used.  However, \"accidental\" implies the causes of injuries are random in nature.[1]  Researchers prefer the term \"unintentional injury\" to refer to injuries that are nonvolitional but often preventable. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control show that unintentional injuries are a significant public health concern: they are by far the leading cause of death from ages 1 through 44.[2]  During these years, unintentional injuries account for more deaths than the next three leading causes of death combined.[2] Unintentional injuries also account for the top ten sources of nonfatal emergency room visits for persons up to age 9 and nine of the top ten sources of nonfatal emergency room visits for persons over the age of 9.[3] \n",

      " When infections such as these occur elsewhere in the body, the host defense system, able to travel the body via the circulatory system, is, more often than not, capable of appropriately gaining access to the site of infection in order to mount a proper and successful retaliation.[5] Dental pulp, which is a richly vascularized and innervated tissue, is enclosed by tissues, such as dentin, which are incapable of expanding. It has terminal blood flow and possesses only small-gauge circulatory access at the apical foramen. All of these characteristics severely constrain the defensive capacity of the pulp tissue when faced with the different aggressions to which it may be subjected.[6][7] As a result, necrotic tissue located within the pulp chamber and canals provide nutrients for pathogenic bacteria to grow and form a periapical lesion;[8] the infected tooth serves as a biochemically and physiologically ideal location for bacterial growth and maturation, and, in essence, acts as a refuge from which bacterial reinforcements can mobilize to the periapical lesion.[9]  It is this concept that serves as the basis for conventional endodontic therapy; both chemical and mechanical debridement procedures are essential in effectively disrupting and removing the microbial ecosystem that is associated with the disease process.[9]  Thus, whenever a pulp is removed and the canal treated and filled in a manner that is compatible with or favorable to a physiologic reaction, we may expect a satisfactory percentage of endodontic success.[10] \n",

There are some advantages by using healthy volunteers. They are in a steady-state condition showing no different stages of disease and no variation due to disease. In addition, it is easy to recruit and select volunteers among varying age, sex, race etc. under identical conditions in which the test can be repeated. \n",
      "The main reasons for this is to avoid trials in the later phases using doses that are significantly different from those that will subsequently be recommended for clinical use and also to avoid the need for modification of dosing schedules at later stages where a large amount of data has already been accumulated for a different dose range.[2]\n",
      "The duration of action should be determined during dose-ranging study, as it will allow definition of the dosage schedule. Because it is hard to measure reliable pharmacodynamic parameter, it is difficult to determine the duration of action during early clinical trials.

The cost-benefit analysis of the suggested risk-based inspection program has shown that this program represents a substantial saving in cost and reduces the radiation exposure during the nuclear plant operation. It is important to mention, the risk-informed in-service inspection program increases vessel safety, because it focuses on any potential additional examinations on those areas which are most likely to experience the probable failure conditions.

Attaching the harness as soon as the hunter is in the tree keeps the hunter safe while setting up for the hunt.

Safety standards are high and generally well enforced, with few serious injuries in comparison to other sports.[7] Steel is generally used for armour (though aluminum, leather and even plastic or carpet may be used if they are covered over).[4] There are a number of armourers that supply the SCA and other living history groups,[5] but many make their own armour, while some participants may import armour from overseas.[3] Armour is generally encouraged to look like its historical counterpart,[4] though differences are often necessary to comply with safety requirements, and sometimes modern sport armour may be used[8]  One of the most common examples is the face of a helmet:  While many types of historical helm had no face protection, safety rules require full coverage of the head.  As a result, there are many variations of helm used in the SCA that are otherwise historically accurate but have a steel grill added to cover the face. These grilled faceplates were also used for tournaments in Europe in the 14th and 15th Centuries, although probably not for actual warfare. Armour costs can vary greatly from DIY, donation, used armour, or spending up to thousands for museum quality armour,[3][8] and may weigh as much as 70 pounds.[4] \n",

Everybody wants to be safe and avoid anxiety, for example, but people with high anxiety sensitivity place a significantly higher value on their safety than does the average person. Reiss's model is based on research on the largest cross-cultural database of human motives ever collected.

      " Given its current status (in 2022) as an emergent type of safety (e.g. as compared with the older idea of physical safety), it is easy to confuse psychological safety with more well-established concepts such as trust and psychological mindfulness.  A primary difference between psychological safety and trust is that psychological safety focuses on a belief about a group norm – emerging from the group's common experiences/perceptions regarding the expected consequences from taking interpersonal risks, in context of its social norms defining the 'correct' in-group behaviours and interactions (e.g. as part of organisational safety culture/climate). Compared with the phenomena of trust, psychological safety has been observed to occur more often in context of larger groups than the typically dyad focused nature of trusting relationships[18](e.g. as a relationship clinicians have in mind with their host organisations[19]); additionally a sort of 'temporally immediate' (i.e. right now) feeling seems to characterise the experience of psychological safety, rather than the typically deferred (i.e. much later) feeling co-present in experiencing trust.[18] These differences between the concepts of psychological safety and trust are becoming established in institutional/organisational study contexts, where trust focuses on a belief and view that one person has about another, whereas psychological safety can be defined by how members of larger social groups think they are viewed by others in the group.[20] \n",

      " The name \"Event Tree\" was first introduced during the WASH-1400 nuclear power plant safety study (circa 1974), where the WASH-1400 team needed an alternate method to fault tree analysis due to the fault trees being too large. Though not using the name event tree, the UKAEA first introduced ETA in its design offices in 1968, initially to try to use whole plant risk assessment to optimize the design of a 500MW Steam-Generating Heavy Water Reactor. This study showed ETA condensed the analysis into a manageable form.[1] ETA was not initially developed during WASH-1400, this was one of the first cases in which it was thoroughly used.  The UKAEA study used the assumption that protective systems either worked or failed, with the probability of failure per demand being calculated using fault trees or similar analysis methods.  ETA identifies all sequences which follow an initiating event.  Many of these sequences can be eliminated from the analysis because their frequency or effect are too small to affect the overall result.  A paper presented at a CREST symposium in Munich, Germany, in 1971 indicated how this was done[citation needed].  The conclusions of the US EPA study of the Draft WASH-1400[3] acknowledges the role of Ref 1 and its criticism of the Maximum Credible Accident approach used by AEC. MCA sets the reliability target for the containment but those for all other safety systems are set by smaller but more frequent accidents and would be missed by MCA. \n",

      " Ba Jia Jiang (Chinese: 八家將; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Pat-ka-chiòng) originated from the Chinese folk beliefs and myths, and usually generally refers to eight members of the godly realm. The general understanding of the origin of Ba Jia Jiang is that it is derived from the existence of eight generals who performed exorcism of evil spirits for the Wufu Emperor (五福大帝). These eight generals became revered as the gods of the underworld, and are represented as the bodyguards or attendants for the temples of the nether Gods such as the Dongyue Emperor (東獄大帝), Yama (King of Hell, 閻羅王) and Cheng Huang (the City Gods, 城隍). Gradually Ba Jia Jiang evolved to appear also as bodyguards to Wang Ye (Royal Lord, 王爺) and Matsu (媽祖), and at many other temples. Later on, believers at those temples dressed up as Ba Jia Jiang in order to defend the Gods. These actions evolved into Taiwanese folk activities, which are part of the Wu Array (Military Array, 武陣) in Din Tao (Taiwanese troupes, 陣頭). Ba Jia Jiang is responsible for the capture of ghosts and evil spirits, bringing safety and good luck, and providing protection. They contain a strong religious nature, and Din Tao (Taiwanese troupes, 陣頭) often seem as mysterious, threatening and serious. Some Ba Jia Jiang members have relations with Taiwanese gangsters.[1] \n",

This was designed to stop the instrument from penetrating too deeply into the bone. It was thought that this would minimize the risk of damage to the brain and meninges. Drills would also be frequently dipped in water to reduce heat, which was supposed to limit the danger of the surgery. The primary purpose of a drill was to remove large diseased portions of skulls. For example, drills were used to remove weapons lodged into the skull.[18] Small drills were used to perforate the nasal bone. Which would create a \"passage for the fluid or matter to the nose,\" thus treating the fistula.[19] Drills were shaped like wine corkscrews.[20] Bone levers were ancient steel tools shaped like rods with flattened and curved tips resembling stone cutters.[21] They were used to level fractures, extract teeth, and realign broken bones.[22][23][24] \n",

Although such a response will nevertheless be available from phase III or phase IV trials, it is important to carry out dose-ranging studies in the earlier phase I or phase II stages. There are some advantages by using healthy volunteers. They are in a steady-state condition showing no different stages of disease and no variation due to disease. In addition, it is easy to recruit and select volunteers among varying age, sex, race etc. under identical conditions in which the test can be repeated. \n",

      "The duration of action should be determined during dose-ranging study, as it will allow definition of the dosage schedule. Because it is hard to measure reliable pharmacodynamic parameter, it is difficult to determine the duration of action during early clinical trials. Other parameters instead are suggested as a tentative dosage, such as half-lives in plasma and urine in various test species and human, receptor binding in vitro, or pharmacodynamic data in vivo in animals.[3]\n",

It has terminal blood flow and possesses only small-gauge circulatory access at the apical foramen. All of these characteristics severely constrain the defensive capacity of the pulp tissue when faced with the different aggressions to which it may be subjected.[6][7] As a result, necrotic tissue located within the pulp chamber and canals provide nutrients for pathogenic bacteria to grow and form a periapical lesion;[8] the infected tooth serves as a biochemically and physiologically ideal location for bacterial growth and maturation, and, in essence, acts as a refuge from which bacterial reinforcements can mobilize to the periapical lesion.[9]  It is this concept that serves as the basis for conventional endodontic therapy; both chemical and mechanical debridement procedures are essential in effectively disrupting and removing the microbial ecosystem that is associated with the disease process.[9]  Thus, whenever a pulp is removed and the canal treated and filled in a manner that is compatible with or favorable to a physiologic reaction, we may expect a satisfactory percentage of endodontic success.[10]\n",

There are some advantages by using healthy volunteers. They are in a steady-state condition showing no different stages of disease and no variation due to disease. In addition, it is easy to recruit and select volunteers among varying age, sex, race etc. under identical conditions in which the test can be repeated. \n",

Because it is hard to measure reliable pharmacodynamic parameter, it is difficult to determine the duration of action during early clinical trials.
