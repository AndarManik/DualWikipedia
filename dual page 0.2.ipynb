      "The game's most frequently employed mechanic is climbing, which is governed by a stamina meter, whereby physically demanding activities, such as jumping or running exert stamina and drain the meter.[9] Once the protagonist's feet are off the ground, everything exerts stamina, even hanging motionlessly.[7][10] Some actions exert more stamina than others - for example, jumping from one beam to another when climbing uses a lot more stamina than shimmying across a beam.[10] The stamina meter refills automatically when the player is on solid ground, unless the protagonist is outside at ground level, where the dust in the air constantly depletes the stamina meter, and eventually the health meter.[8] If the player runs out of stamina when climbing, they are allowed a few seconds for a final exertion to try to get to solid ground. However, such exertion results in a piece of the stamina meter itself disappearing (thus reducing the maximum stamina the player can have). This loss can only be restored by using a specific item.[11][12] To aid in climbing, the player can use pitons, which allow the protagonist to rest and recharge his stamina mid-climb. Each piton can only be used in a single location; once they are placed into a wall, they cannot be removed.[8][13]\n",

The Kickstarter concluded with over $2 million pledged, allowing Poots to develop plans for game expansions.[9] Poots believed that he and his team \"over-delivered\" on this campaign, making him feel \"responsible and humbled\" by the support from players, and he started to use the profits from additional sales toward further development and expansion of the game.[8]\n",

The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres.[54] The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.[10]\n",

Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games[1] and use much of the same terminology, settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replay value and immersion.

He also believed games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective of saving the protagonist from danger.[9] As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them.[7][1][9] Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision.[7][1] Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982,[6] but the project was only put on the schedule as an actual product several months later.[Note 2]\n",

Game mechanics, on the other hand, is the sets of rules in a game that are intended to produce an enjoyable gaming experience. Academic discussions tend to favor game mechanics specifically to avoid gameplay since the latter is too vague.[13] The word is sometimes misapplied to card games where, however, the usual term is \"play\" and refers to the way the cards are played out in accordance with the rules (as opposed to other aspects such as dealing or bidding).\n",

Dolphin[3][6] collides with a meteor and lands in a new planet. To manage to escape and go home, he uses the native species of anthropomorphic plants—the Pikmin—to help him find the 30 parts of his ship in the 30 days his life support systems can support him.[7][8] In Pikmin 2 (2004), he returns from the Pikmin planet to learn that Hocotate Freight is in severe debt. After discovering that some things he has brought back from the Pikmin planet are extremely valuable, his boss sends him and a co-worker, Louie, to the planet to find more of it in order to pay down the company's debt.[9] Olimar is not the main character in Pikmin 3 (2013),[10] but he appears in the game through his journal entries that instruct the player how to use the Pikmin as well as the game mechanics,[11][12] and in the multiplayer mode \"Bingo Battle\".[11] Player characters Alph, Brittany, and Charlie, who crash-landed on the planet shortly after Olimar, seek to locate him in order to retrieve a crucial piece of their ship, which he took mistaking it for treasure. The final level has the player characters attempt to rescue Olimar from the game's final boss, the Plasm Wraith. In the game's Nintendo Switch port, Pikmin 3 Deluxe (2020), Olimar appears as a playable character alongside Louie in an additional story campaign. Olimar reappears as the only playable character in the spin-off game Hey! Pikmin (2017), where he crash-lands on an unknown planet in his new ship, the S.S. Dolphin II. He learns that in order to bring his ship back in working order, he must collect 30,000 of the substance known as Sparklium. He soon re-encounters Pikmin, which he figures out he can use to carry Sparklium-rich treasures and seeds. Once the player gathers up 30,000 Sparklium, Olimar learns he must retrieve an essential component needed to repair the ship, the Sparklium Converter. However, it is revealed that it was eaten by the Beserk Leech Hydroe, a giant plant-like creature which he must fight. After defeating it and obtaining the converter, Olimar heads back to his home planet, Hocotate.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2011, Nintendo released Skyward Sword, which aimed to develop an early history of the fictional kingdom of Hyrule and create an origin story for the Master Sword.[23] Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma commented that the game's premise was based on a desire to focus the story on the gameplay experience, which was built around the game's motion controls: \"This time, the theme is the sword which makes use of the Wii MotionPlus accessory... When you think of a sword in The Legend of Zelda, you think of the Master Sword. Rather early on, we decided to address the origin of the Master Sword\". The story concept placed the sword at the centre of Zelda lore, but as it was not the first video game released in the series, the plot suffered from inconsistencies in relation to the pre-existing timeline. Skyward Sword director Hidemaro Fujibayashi explained: \"We settled on having the sky and surface world, and on top of that, it was going to tell the story of the creation of Hyrule, with the untold story of the origin of the Master Sword... So, looking back at the series so far, we began knitting together the various elements. And then all sorts of contradictions arose\".[23] Despite these inconsistencies, the storyline established the Master Sword as a defining element of the narrative. The plot centres around Link transforming the weapon into the Master Sword. It gives Link the power to defeat the antagonist Demon King Demise by trapping his essence inside the sword. This storyline was the foundation for the lore of every other title in The Legend of Zelda series, with the Master Sword placed at the heart of its mythology.[24] The sword was also used as the central game mechanic for the Wii version of Skyward Sword. A television commercial for the game's release in 2011 prominently featured the Master Sword as a way to connect the player to the game's motion controls, which involved using the Wii MotionPlus to control the sword's movements on screen.[25]\n",

To accomplish this, we made a number of key design decisions, from the player's ability to effect the world in a believable way (killing friendly humans), to the storytelling techniques we used, to the morality system that leads to the distinct endings. In the end though, the compatibility of a game about human atrocities over the ages within the \"gory shooter\" game milieu was perhaps our biggest limitation. As games seek to engage the player with more and more serious subject matter, the game mechanics need to evolve along with them, giving the player a wider expressive range than deciding whether to kill or not to kill.

The game also penalizes the player's ranking for the number of times they have taken cover, though its most important innovation is the power-slide mechanic that allows the player to slide into and out of cover at high speeds, or in bullet time when the player's health is low.[43] The game was given GameSpot's Best Original Game Mechanic award for its rocket-sliding game mechanic, which acts as both a defensive escape and an offensive setup, opening up new gameplay possibilities for shooter games and increasing the pace significantly.[44] Vanquish was itself inspired by Tatsunoko's 1970s anime series, Casshern.[45]\n",

The team diversified Thief II by designing missions with such objectives as kidnapping, blackmail and eavesdropping.[9] The first two levels were designed to seamlessly introduce new players to the core game mechanics, without a tutorial mission that might lose the interest of experienced players.[10] When creating a mission, the team would often begin by deciding on the player's objective, after which they would produce a rough level design. The mission would then undergo a peer review to determine if it should be added to the game.[43] Each of the game's levels was a team effort rather than the work of a single designer.[8] Designer Randy Smith explained that, while Thief's levels had been designed to fit a pre-existing story, the Thief II team \"tried to think of really good missions first\" and then adjusted the plot to suit them.

If the player tries to shoot or attack a non-aggressive target, Tony will refuse to act; if the player tries to hit an innocent person with a car, they will only be injured. This keeps in line with the character's refusal to kill innocent men, women and children.[9] As the game progresses, the player acquires access to some of Tony's employees as he rebuilds his empire: a driver, a boat pilot who can smuggle larger hauls of cocaine, an arms dealer who can supply weapons, an enforcer to protect Tony's businesses and attack those of his rivals, and a hitman who can eliminate other gangsters and dealers.[10] When these employees have been unlocked, the player can switch control from Tony to any one of them (except the arms dealer), and when playing as the enforcer or the hitman, the player can kill innocent people.[9]\n",

Sega's marketing team suggested a game based on the casino levels of the first two games.  A pinball game pitch came from Morawiec, who had previously worked on the special stages in Sonic 2.[31] Morawiec drew inspiration from the 1992 Amiga game Pinball Dreams to combine pinball mechanics with the gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog. His team at STI was given nine months to develop the game, which Morawiec considered a \"tight\" schedule. To speed up production, Sega sent veteran staff from Japan to assist, including Sonic the Hedgehog artist Katsuhiko Sato.[32] Additionally, Hector hired more programmers and assured his team that the game would be done on time.[31] STI staff also changed the programming language from assembly to C, an unusual choice for Genesis games at the time, which caused frame rate and optimization problems but greatly accelerated development. A last-minute difficulty occurred when the team learned that Sega did not own the theme to Sonic the Hedgehog, which had been used in Spinball. Morawiec tasked lead composer Drossin to write a new theme within two hours.[32] Though it received poor reviews, Sonic Spinball sold well and helped to build the reputation of its developers.[5]\n",

In December, Blue Byte released an expansion, The Settlers II Mission CD, featuring new single-player campaign missions, new maps for both single-player and multiplayer modes, and a map editor. In October 1997, they released The Settlers II: Gold Edition, containing the original game, plus the Mission CD expansion, along with minor graphical enhancements and gameplay tweaks. The Gold Edition was also ported to Mac OS in 1997. In 2006, an enhanced remake, The Settlers II (10th Anniversary), was released for Microsoft Windows. In 2007, the Gold Edition was ported to the Nintendo DS, under the title The Settlers, released in Germany in July, and in the United Kingdom and North America in August. Although adapted for the dual-screen display of the DS, and with controls specifically programmed for use with the DS stylus, the gameplay, game mechanics, graphics and storyline are unaltered.

In another review published in PC Magazine, Barry Brenesal is generally positive about the game, but considers its \"single weak element\" to be its handling of ground character movement.[7]  On planetary excursions, team members often become separated when the party is traveling through doors or corridors with multiple paths.  Reviewer Scott A. May, writing for Compute!, declared the game to be a \"minor masterpiece of size, imagination, and diversity of play\" marred by a \"few rough spots\" including \"a clumsy, limited character interface\" for controlling team members during planetary exploration.[8]  The game was also reviewed in 1992 in Dragon #182 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column.

In August, Blue Byte released an expansion, The Settlers IV Mission CD, featuring new single-player campaign missions, new maps for both single-player and multiplayer modes, a random map generator and map editor, gameplay improvements, and bug fixes. In December, they released a second expansion, The Settlers IV: The Trojans and the Elixir of Power (German: Die Siedler IV: Die Trojaner und das Elixier der Macht), containing new single-player campaigns, additional single and multiplayer maps, improved graphics, and additional gameplay tweaks. In March 2002, The Settlers IV: Gold Edition was released, containing the original game and both expansions, plus fan-made maps for multiplayer mode, and two minigames. In November 2009,  Gameloft ported the original game to iOS, under the title The Settlers. Although featuring updated graphics and utilising touch controls, the gameplay, game mechanics and storyline are identical to the original. In April 2010, The Settlers was released for webOS, specifically optimised for the Palm Pre. Gameloft later released HD versions for iPad, bada, Symbian and Android. In 2013, the Gold Edition was released on GOG.com. In 2018, the game was re-released as The Settlers IV: History Edition.\n",

The graphics support this 3D environment in the form of cliffs, other terrain, buildings etc. The game also features an interesting game mechanic - the view has two aspects of North and South to switch between.

However, such exertion results in a piece of the stamina meter itself disappearing (thus reducing the maximum stamina the player can have). This loss can only be restored by using a specific item.[11][12] To aid in climbing, the player can use pitons, which allow the protagonist to rest and recharge his stamina mid-climb. Each piton can only be used in a single location; once they are placed into a wall, they cannot be removed.[8][13]\n",

It used data that it analyzed through 90,000 apps that installed the company's software in order to roughly determine the amount of revenue generated by other popular apps. They discovered that free games represented 39% of the total revenue from January, and that the number jumped to 65% by June, helped in part by the fact that over 75% of the 100 top grossing apps are games. This makes free-to-play the single most dominant business model in the mobile apps industry. They also learned that the number of people that spend money on in-game items in free-to-play games ranges from 0.5% to 6%, depending on a game's quality and mechanics. Even though this means that a large number of people will never spend money in a game, it also means that the people that do spend money could amount to a sizeable number because the game was given away for free.[44]\n",

Having done so, they elected to combine some of the more popular game mechanics from previous titles in the series; the road network from The Settlers and The Settlers II; expansion by means of military outposts from The Settlers, The Settlers II, The Settlers III and The Settlers IV; a correlation between military strength and the prosperity of one's city from The Settlers IV; and heroes, taxation, and soldier's salary from Heritage of Kings. Feeling that Heritage took the series too far from its city-building origins and more in the direction of a traditional combat-based real-time strategy, the designers scaled back the importance, frequency, and difficulty of combat. Similarly, wanting to streamline and re-focus the gameplay, they also simplified the economic model, removing micromanagement and complicated daisy-chain economic processes.\n",

      "Simultaneous action selection, or SAS, is a game mechanic that occurs when players of a game take action (such as moving their pieces) at the same time. Examples of games that use this type of movement include rock–paper–scissors and Diplomacy. Typically, a \"secret yet binding\" method of committing to one's move is necessary, so that as players' moves are revealed and implemented, others do not change their moves in light of the new information. Thus, in Diplomacy, players write down their moves and then reveal them simultaneously. Because no player gets the first move, this potentially arbitrary source of advantage is not present. It is also possible for simultaneous movement games to proceed relatively quickly, because players are acting at the same time, rather than waiting for their turn.

From a gameplay perspective, although each game tends to feature its own set of innovations and nuances, broadly speaking, they are all built on a simulation of a supply and demand economic system in which the player must maintain the various chains of production, building up their military strength and the robustness of their economy so as to defeat their opponents and achieve certain predetermined objectives. Some games foreground city-building and complex daisy-chain economic processes whereas others focus on real-time strategy and building a diverse military force. Common game mechanics include resource acquisition, economic micromanagement, managing taxation, maintaining a high standard of living, trade, and technology trees.\n",

He wanted to create a game which explored \"knowledge chains\", where the player must not only be aware of his knowledge and movements on the board, but also how much of that has been exposed to the opponent.[6] In March 2009, he was invited by publisher Majesco Entertainment to pitch an idea for a Nintendo DS game, and keeping these mechanics in mind, he pitched a game called Deception. In Deception, two players would play one half of a married couple, with the aim to gather damaging evidence regarding their spouse's infidelities as ammunition for a forthcoming divorce case.

The team also thought that it would become an irritation if they added too many complex mechanics for the wildlife.[28] The developer also intentionally chose not to make Evolve action-packed all the time, and introduced segments that would require players to slow down and track the Monster. Robb explained that the design team wanted to create a contrast, so that players could appreciate the action and chaotic moments after experiencing the less exciting segments.[34]\n",

They thought of themselves as artists and of their work as experimental.[3] Boxleiter and Wohlwend worked long hours when making the Flash games, which they found exciting and unsustainable.[5] At Intuition, they worked on games such as Dinowaurs, Gray, Fig. 8, and Liferaft and participated in at least six game jams.[2] As of April 2010, they had created 10 games together.[3]\n",

Instead, he turned to YouTube videos and external FAQs before playing each game.[4] Eurogamer and Ars Technica disagreed on the virtues of having the Spectrum emulator replicate the graphical glitches of the original console.[32][4] Jaz Rignall of USgamer appreciated the added option to save game progress at any time for the Spectrum games, and wrote that the collection will remind players how difficult games used to be.[7]\n",

The event, known then as What Would Molydeux? and later as Molyjam, soon grew from a San Francisco-based affair into an international, multisite event with satellite locations in the Netherlands, New York City, and Melbourne in 32 total locations. The event was held the weekend of March 30, and around 1,000 attendees made around 300 games, of which Capone found 15 games interesting. Professional cameos included David Hellman (Braid) in San Francisco and Peter Molyneux himself in London, where he gave an uncharacteristically fiery keynote speech that encouraged developers to \"innovate ... come together and do crazy things\".[1] While most games tended to consist of normal game mechanics underneath a bizarre concept, Wired said that their inability to deliver on their promise was the jam's \"most Molyneuxian touch\".[1]\n",

Celeste was designed to be accessible, featuring game mechanics intended to make the game more forgiving in addition to an \"Assist Mode\" offering several options to make the game less challenging. The themes of self-forgiveness present in the narrative began with the idea of creating a \"more introspective\" game, and later grew to become intertwined with the gameplay.

Based on his research into ancient war, he determined that Macedonia relied on a combined arms approach, while Persia favored ranged combat and Greece relied on infantry charges. To capture this clash via game mechanics, Herman categorized each unit into a specific tactical system: when units of rival tactical systems collide in shock combat, a bonus is awarded to the unit with the better system. He noted, \"Many wargames treat all combat units as a singular entity while only varying speed and strength to show unit distinctions. I believe this approach is fundamentally wrong and removes most of what is important about tactical interactions in combat.\" Seeking also to capture the effects of leadership in the ancient world, he created the game's phasing turn structure, which allowed leaders to better display their initiative and range of influence in gameplay.[21]\n",

      "In Maguss, players may challenge monsters or other players in a combat. Duels are semi-turned based: each combat cycle, both participants cast spells during the allotted time, after which the spell effects are resolved one at a time, in a sequence alternating between the player and the enemy. The winner is awarded gold and experience points. Another game mechanic to duels is Heat, indicated by a meter and representing a wizard's stamina for spellcasting. The more powerful a spell, the more Heat it generates when used. Once a player overheats, they cannot cast a spell until they cool off again. The game offers 2 PvP modes: Proximity Mode, where players may duel nearby wizards, or a Ranked League through a global matchmaking system. Ranked Leagues run for 30-day long seasons, each with their own unique theme. For each Ranked League win, players earn Competitive Points which they can exchange for that season's unique armour illusions. Based on their final rank at the end of the season, players gain various rewards consisting of Competitive Points, League Badges, and Season icons.\n",

Players can also move between batteries by pressing either 1, 3, 4 or 6 on the controller's keypad. Similarly to 3D mode, power-ups are randomly dropped by destroyed enemy aircraft and they range from laser upgrades, which improves the firepower of the battery's laser cannons up to four times, ammo to refill laser energy and missiles, among others. There are only three stages in this mode, each one divided into three waves and having their own thematic. In addition, bosses are now introduced at the end of each wave. The game ends once all cities or batteries in the level are destroyed. It is the only mode that features support for the unreleased Jaguar VR headset.[5]\n",

The first is Yoko Taro, who wrote a scenario based on Nier: Automata for this game's large-scale raids.[5] Yoshida enjoys working with outside creators because they provide a different perspective and can challenge the development team to try new ideas.[5] Yoko's producer Yosuke Saito suggested the collaboration near the launch of Nier: Automata in 2017.[48] Players inundated the team with requests for Nier-themed costumes, but Yoshida wanted to wait to create a more thorough and in-depth crossover.[2] In \"YoRHa: Dark Apocalypse\", the adventurer joins the Dwarven twins Anogg and Konogg to investigate an archaeological dig site swarming with machine lifeforms. They meet an android dressed in white named 2P who aids them in defeating the machines. In addition to the story, this series of raids borrows game mechanics and character models from the Nier games as well, the latter contributed by PlatinumGames, the developer of Nier: Automata.[49] As Yoko is known for deleting the player's save data at the end of his games, he jokingly threatened to delete all player and server data for Final Fantasy XIV at the end of the Nier crossover story.[49][50] Another guest collaborator is Tetsuya Nomura, who was invited to contribute character designs for the \"Eden\" raids, inspired by the creature from Final Fantasy VIII.[51][52] He received story and lore notes but had free rein to interpret them how he wished.[33] Yoshida considers Nomura's designs to be an \"essence\" of Final Fantasy and desired his work to be represented in Final Fantasy XIV.[6] Finally, Yasumi Matsuno returned to write the \"Save the Queen\" storyline, a continuation of the \"Return to Ivalice\" arc from Stormblood.[53] It is based on an unused idea for a sequel to Vagrant Story that was never produced.[54]\n",

Their company was clearly stuck between a proverbial 'rock and a hard place,' as backing one party over any of the others in this conflict could potentially be a detrimental financial decision for them\".[155] In the ComicBook.com podcast The Character Sheet, Christian Hoffer speculated that Critical Role could be under contract to use the 5th edition system for the remainder of Campaign 3, and that there might be \"non-disparity clauses\" preventing them from speaking out against Hasbro, its subsidiaries, and its products.[158] In an interview with Codega, Ray stated \"it's important to have an environment that does allow these creators; independent, big, small, to create and make new things. Whichever way allows the community to do that, that's where we're going to stand and support\".[159] On the draft OGL1.2 separating some Dungeons & Dragons content into a Creative Commons license, Mercer stated it was \"a grandiose step in a grandiose direction.

In most stages, players encounter many different enemies, including carnivorous plants, goblins, rabid wolves and giant insects. Minibosses and tougher enemies soon enter the stage in the form of environment-specific knights and Scourge knights. Dealing with some enemies in Flynn: Son of Crimson can be as simple as dodge-rolling at the right moment to avoid incoming attacks, then dealing damage from behind or by using more advanced techniques, such as freezing them in place or instantly stunning them with electric magic. A stun meter is introduced early in the game and is used throughout to allow players to build up a yellow gauge above the enemy until it becomes stunned (shown by dizzying stars) for a few seconds.

To accomplish this, we made a number of key design decisions, from the player's ability to effect the world in a believable way (killing friendly humans), to the storytelling techniques we used, to the morality system that leads to the distinct endings. In the end though, the compatibility of a game about human atrocities over the ages within the \"gory shooter\" game milieu was perhaps our biggest limitation. As games seek to engage the player with more and more serious subject matter, the game mechanics need to evolve along with them, giving the player a wider expressive range than deciding whether to kill or not to kill.

      "The game was designed and co-programmed by Volker Wertich, creator of the original Settlers game. Although the core supply and demand-based gameplay is broadly the same as in previous titles, many of the game mechanics have been altered; the player now has direct control over their army; roads are no longer necessary to connect buildings, headquarters no longer automatically generate settlers as required, and the different races now have different economic models, different magic spells, and several unique abilities and buildings. The game was also the first in the series to feature online multiplayer.\n",

      "In designing Paths to a Kingdom, Blue Byte explicitly set out to correct the perceived problems of the two previous Settlers titles; Heritage of Kings (which had been criticised for focusing too heavily on combat) and Rise of an Empire (which had been criticised for its overly simplistic economic models). Roughly basing the game on the most acclaimed title in the series, The Settlers II, the designers foregrounded such popular features as road networks and complex daisy-chain economic processes, whilst emphasising economic micromanagement, technology trees, and trade requirements. The designers also introduced new game mechanics, particularly a dynamic Victory Points system. Additionally, for the first time in the series, the player can choose to develop their settlement along three different lines; military, technology, and/or trade, with each one requiring different gameplay strategies and styles of play. Shortly after the game's release, it became embroiled in controversy when a fault in Ubisoft's newly launched always-on DRM prevented thousands of players from playing the game over the Easter weekend.\n",

      "['At the core of Game mechanics lies the concept of physics, level design, graphics, gravity, soundtrack, setting, story, dimension-flipping, originality, and text. These elements are used to create innovative gameplay mechanics, such as tree teetering, rope swinging, wire walking, and other features. Ports and remakes of games often rely heavily on the original assets and engine, but may include various enhancements such as improved performance, resolution, and additional content.', 'At the core of Game mechanics is the ability to defeat opponents with one hit using either a sword or a bullet, as well as the ability to deflect attacks with precise timing. Additionally, the game mechanics involve the use of platforming, health-and-weapon systems, and periodic physics puzzles. Exploration is also rewarded and encouraged, with optional areas that can be missed or avoided. The game mechanics also involve the use of colorful, higher resolution art styles, additional weapons, and ten arenas.', 'At the core of Game mechanics is the ability to effect the world in a believable way, the storytelling techniques used, the morality system that leads to the distinct endings, the compatibility of a game within the \"gory shooter\" game milieu, the player\\'s ability to develop their settlement along three different lines; military, technology, and/or trade, the implementation of the whip, the enemy AI, the narrative, main character, and script, the in-depth tutorial that does not require players to read the manual, and the success of the game shifting Nintendo\\'s attitude over Western tastes.', 'At the core of Game mechanics is the concept of using various elements to create an interactive and engaging experience. This includes elements such as role-playing, spreading rumors, writing letters, character creation systems, real-time exploration, trading, interaction with non-player characters, combat, problem solving, ground, air, and naval combat, and permanent changes over the course of a series of sessions. These elements are used in various types of games, such as tabletop role-playing games, video games, and legacy games, to create an immersive and enjoyable experience.']\n",

      "On one side Sublime (philosophy) is the idea of the sublime and the beauty of the natural world. Edmund Burke in his 1757 A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful argued that the soft gentle curves appealed to the male sexual desire, while the sublime horrors appealed to our desires for self-preservation. Picturesque arose as a mediator between these opposed ideals of beauty and the sublime, showing the possibilities that existed between these two rationally idealised states. Julia Kristeva argued that the sublime is really our effort to cover over the breakdowns (and subsequent reassertion of boundaries) associated with the abject; and literature is the privileged space for both the sublime and abject. Costa defined a more general, comprehensive, aesthetic and philosophical, theory of new media, which he named the technological sublime. Lloyd's paintings are influenced by cinema, in particular film noir and science fiction, and the Romantic conception of the sublime. Steven DaLuz is a contemporary American Neoluminist artist known for using chemically induced patinas on metal leaf and mixed media to produce figurative works and imagined landscapes often reflecting upon the sublime as a pictorial theme. The Shipwreck is a landscape painting by J. M. W. Turner in the collection of the Tate and is an important example of the sublime in British art. Shaftesbury's philosophical work was limited to ethics, religion, and aesthetics where he highlighted the concept of the sublime as an aesthetic quality. On the other side of Sublime (philosophy) is the concept of the sublime in relation to physical objects and counter-experience, the Gothic Revival architecture and its association with the sublime, the influence of Thomas Gray, William Gilpin, and Edmund Burke on the concept of the sublime, and the influence of the Romantic conception of the sublime on art and literature. It also mentions the influence of Shaftesbury's philosophical work on the concept of the sublime.\n",

Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight). The game\\'s large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.\\n\\nDocument 2: \\n\\nGames can be extended with new content and software patches through either expansion packs which are typically available as physical media, or as downloadable content nominally available via digital distribution. These can be offered freely or can be used to monetize a game following its initial release. Several games offer players the ability to create user-generated content to share with others to play. Other games, mostly those on personal computers, can be extended with user-created modifications or mods that alter or add onto the game; these often are unofficial and were developed by players from reverse engineering of the game, but other games provide official support for modding the game.[43]\\n\\nDocument 3: \\n\\nThe game allows users to interact with one another as avatars and features development tools for players to create in-game elements such as games and maps.\\n\\nDocument 4: \\n\\nThe game\\'s gameplay is the same as the original PlayStation 3 version, albeit without the co-operative multiplayer aspect and one of the \\'layers\\'with in which the level \\'set\\' is creatdn. The PlayStation 3 version has three \\'thick\\' layers and four \\'thin\\' layer,,butr LittleBigPlanet PSP only has two \\'thick\\' layers and three \\'thin\\' layers. The game features an all new campaign with brand new level;,itd consists of an introduction, 23 main levels, and 14 mini levels,two2 of which are \"Mini Games\".[3] These levels were created by SCE Studio Cambridge, and are basedond seven different themes that draw inspiration from real-world locations including Chinese gardens, dry Australian deserts and icy Alpine stages.[4] Players must traverse complicated mazes during levels using devices including switches, rotating platforms and floating lanterns that can be ridden or grabbed. The main objective of each level is to move from one side of the stage to the other, dodging deadly contraptions such as electric snakes shooting out and trying to kill your sackperson.[3] The game also features user-generated content similar to the PlayStation 3 original.\\n\\nDocument 5: \\n\\nDreams is a game creation system video game developed by Media Molecule and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4 in February 2020.

New improvements in equipment, software, the advancement of speed and access have increased the level and quality of connectivity. Along with these improvements, new media such as social networking systems (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+), websites that provide access to user-generated content (e.g. Youtube, Myspace, Flickr), trading and marketing sites (e.g. Amazon, eBay, Groupon) and also game sites (e.g. FarmVille, The Sims Social) have become an essential part of everyday life of an average user:[2] \"Just as electricity in the 19th and 20th centuries transformed societies by penetrating every fibre of people’s personal and professional lives, network connectivity is probably the most powerful transformative force in early 21st-century cultures\".[4] This made a shift in the understanding of the nature of connectivity and moved the initial focus just from a technical side of the notion to its increasingly acquired techno-socio-cultural character.[4][5]\\n\\nDocument 8: \\n\\nAs such, the platform offers a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos.\\n\\nDocument 9: \\n\\nThe focus of science.tv is user-generated content, and much of the content on the site is actually embedded from other video sites, including YouTube.
