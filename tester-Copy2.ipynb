The key issues of this socio-political movement are the conservation of natural resources, elimination of pollution, and the usage of land.[45] Although diverse in interests and goals, environmentalists as a group tend to advocate sustainable management of resources and stewardship of the environment through changes in public policy and individual behavior.[46] Of particular concern is the large-scale exploitation of non-renewable resources.[47] Changes sought by the environmental movements are sometimes in conflict with commercial interests due to the additional costs associated with managing the environmental impact of those interests.[48][49][50]\n",

Techniques such as carbon recapture may also be used to sequester carbon compounds produced in urban centers rather continually emitting more of the greenhouse gas.[66] The use of other types of renewable energy like bioenergy, solar energy, geothermal energy, and wind energy would also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[67]\n",

Locke was apparently influenced by René Descartes' statement normally translated 'I think, therefore I am' (Cogito ergo sum). In chapter XXVII \"On Identity and Diversity\" of Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689) he conceptualized consciousness as the repeated self-identification of oneself through which moral responsibility could be attributed to the subject—and therefore punishment and guiltiness justified, as critics such as Nietzsche would point out, affirming \"...the psychology of conscience is not 'the voice of God in man'; it is the instinct of cruelty ... expressed, for the first time, as one of the oldest and most indispensable elements in the foundation of culture.\"[40][41][42] John Locke does not himself use the terms self-awareness or self-consciousness. According to Locke, personal identity (the self) \"depends on consciousness, not on substance\".[43] We are the same person to the extent that we are conscious of our past and future thoughts and actions in the same way as we are conscious of our present thoughts and actions. If consciousness is this \"thought\" which doubles all thoughts, then personal identity is only founded on the repeated act of consciousness: \"This may show us wherein personal identity consists: not in the identity of substance, but ... in the identity of consciousness.\" For example, one may claim to be a reincarnation of Plato, therefore having the same soul. However, one would be the same person as Plato only if one had the same consciousness of Plato's thoughts and actions that he himself did. Therefore, self-identity is not based on the soul. One soul may have various personalities.[43]\n",
