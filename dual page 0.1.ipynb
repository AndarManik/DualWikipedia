The process, still used by the university in modified form, was created by Christopher Alexander, whose works also directly inspired the creation of the Wiki. Some research for the book A Pattern Language, which inspired the Design Patterns movement and Extreme Programming, was done by Alexander in Eugene.

There is an extensive wiki devoted to curating and cataloging the various aspects of the game.[29] From the earliest days, it has been a favorite in computer labs, both for its theoretical interest and as a practical exercise in programming and data display. Conway came to dislike how discussions of him heavily focused on his Game of Life, feeling that it overshadowed deeper and more important things he had done, although he remaimed proud of his work on it.[30] The game helped to launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of cellular automata.[31]\n",

      "The term \"blooper\" or \"flub,\" is often applied to describe continuity errors and other mistakes that have escaped the notice of film editors and directors and have made it into a final, televised or released product, where these errors are subsequently identified by viewers. For example, in a film taking place in the Old West, a viewer might spot a twentieth century vehicle driving in the distance of one shot, or in a film taking place in ancient Greece, an actor may have forgotten to remove his wristwatch and it was caught on film. Or it might be a piece of clothing, such as shoes, that change for one shot then change back with no explanation. Strictly speaking, however, these are film errors, and not \"bloopers\" since they did not occur in outtake footage or a live broadcast. The Internet Movie Database website uses the term goofs instead. In the mid-1990s, author Phil Farrand published a series of Nit-Picker's Guides books in which he collected continuity errors and other on-screen \"bloopers\" from various Star Trek series that had been identified by either himself or fans; the listing of such information is commonplace on wiki-style websites devoted to TV and film production.[citation needed]\n",

This \"multimodal\" approach was called a \"happening\" by Ross Mayfield.[10] The conversation resulted in Ito's online article that generated discussions about the potential for weblogs and other social software tools to influence participation in governance. The discussion and notes were captured in a paper that was placed on a wiki for collaborative editing and enhancement. Jon Lebkowsky edited the wiki version, and published it as a chapter in the 2005 book Extreme Democracy.[11] A \"teach-in\" on that topic was held on February 9, 2004, as part of the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference.[12]\n",

Depth of will expression was obtained by limiting participant numbers through representative democracy (refer to the Table). The social media Web 2.0 revolution has demonstrated the possibility of achieving both large group sizes and depth of will expression. However, expressions of will in social media are unstructured, making their interpretation challenging and often subjective (see Table). Novel information processing methods, including big data analytics and the semantic web, suggest potential ways to exploit these capabilities for future e-democracy implementations.[60] Currently, e-democracy processes are facilitated by technologies such as electronic mailing lists, peer-to-peer networks, collaborative software, and apps like GovernEye, Countable, VoteSpotter, wikis, internet forums, and blogs.\n",

      "BZFlag has three types of flags: team flags, bad flags and super flags.[8] Team flags are only placed in a world during a capture-the-flag game, and represent the team it is colored to. Super flags are flags that can be in both free-for-all games and capture-the-flag games, but are strongly controlled by a server operator. The number, types of super flags, as well as where they are placed can all be controlled by the operator. Super flags come in both bad and good form, and affect a tank accordingly. A bad flag may take away a certain sense of the tank: its sight, speed, or related things, while a good flag does the opposite and actually helps a tank. Good super flags are usually held until the tank is killed and explodes, or until the player driving the tank chooses to drop the flag. Bad flags are dropped after a short amount of time, after a certain number of \"wins\", or until the tank dies. The rules for dropping bad flags are set by the operator. All super flags have a one or two letter code that is displayed next to a player's name on the scoreboard when that player has that flag. Once in a while, a new flag is introduced, which anyone can contribute to via developer contact or the wiki.[7]\n",

Managing the Intelligent Enterprise relies on these tools, as well as methods for group member interaction; promotion of creative thinking; group membership feedback; quality control and peer review; and a documented group memory or knowledge base. As groups work together, they develop a shared memory, which is accessible through the collaborative artifacts created by the group, including meeting minutes, transcripts from threaded discussions, and drawings. The shared memory (group memory) is also accessible through the memories of group members; current interest focuses on how technology can support and augment the effectiveness of shared past memory and capacity for future problem-solving. Metaknowledge characterizes how knowledge content interacts with its knowledge context in cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional, or global distributed collaboration.[22]\n",

Sunstein's 2004 book, The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever, advocates the Second Bill of Rights proposed by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, Republic.com, argued that the Internet may weaken democracy because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as cyberbalkanization.\n",

For example, Wikipedia content is user-designed. Users are given the necessary tools to make their own entries.

In addition, the Internet allows for the pooling of design resources using open source principles. Using wiki models or crowdsourcing approaches, for example, a social entrepreneur organization can get hundreds of people from across a country (or from multiple countries) to collaborate on joint online projects (e.g., developing a business plan or a marketing strategy for a social entrepreneurship venture). These websites help social entrepreneurs to disseminate their ideas to broader audiences, help with the formation and maintenance of networks of like-minded people and help to link up potential investors, donors or volunteers with the organization. This enables social entrepreneurs to achieve their goals with little or no start-up capital and little or no \"brick and mortar\" facilities (e.g., rented office space). For example, the rise of open-source appropriate technology as a sustainable development paradigm enables people all over the world to collaborate on solving local problems, just as open source software development leverages collaboration from software experts from around the world.[citation needed] The COVID-19 pandemic and the need to physically distance has further increased the significance of technologies for social ventures.[57]\n",

Separating belief from naming and definition also helps to clarify this issue, and show how concepts can be held in common, even in the face of differing beliefs.  For instance, wiki as a medium may permit such confusion but disciplined users can apply dispute resolution methods to sort out their conflicts.  It is also argued that most people share a common set of \"semantic primitives\", fundamental concepts, to which they refer when they are trying to explain unfamiliar terms to other people.  An ontology that includes representations of those semantic primitives could in such a case be used to create logical descriptions of any term that a person may wish to define logically.   That ontology would be one form of upper ontology, serving as a logical \"interlingua\" that can translate ideas in one terminology to its logical equivalent in another terminology.\n",

The majority of Nupedia's experts, however, wanted nothing to do with this project, fearing that mixing amateur content with professionally researched and edited material would compromise the integrity of Nupedia's information and damage the credibility of the encyclopedia.[29] Thus, the wiki project, dubbed \"Wikipedia\" by Sanger,[30] went live at a separate domain five days after its creation.[19][24]\n",

      "Web pages were initially conceived as structured documents based upon HTML. They could include images, video, and other content, although the use of media was initially relatively limited and the content was mainly static. By the mid-2000s, new approaches to sharing and exchanging content, such as blogs and RSS, rapidly gained acceptance on the Web. The video-sharing website YouTube launched the concept of user-generated content.[81] As new technologies made it easier to create websites that behaved dynamically, the Web attained greater ease of use and gained a sense of interactivity which ushered in a period of rapid popularization. This new era also brought into existence social networking websites, such as Friendster, MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, and photo- and video-sharing websites such as Flickr and, later, Instagram which gained users rapidly and became a central part of youth culture. Wikipedia's user-edited content quickly displaced the professionally-written Microsoft Encarta.[82] The popularity of these sites, combined with developments in the technology that enabled them, and the increasing availability and affordability of high-speed connections made video content far more common on all kinds of websites. This new media-rich model for information exchange, featuring user-generated and user-edited websites, was dubbed Web 2.0, a term coined in 1999 and popularized in 2004 at the Web 2.0 Conference. The Web 2.0 boom drew investment from companies worldwide and saw many new service-oriented startups catering to a newly \"democratized\" Web.[83][84][85][86][87][88]\n",

An important goal of the project is building in flexibility so that changes in technology in the future will not damage the archive; this flexibility includes using metadata for all archived data.[3] Other long-term objectives involve agreements between participating institutions about what information will be preserved and how the preservation will be carried out, how copyrighted material will be handled, and how universities can be assured that their faculty and students have access to their archived data.[3]\n",

      "Many dictionaries and encyclopedias rushed into CD-ROM editions soon after the widespread introduction of the CD-ROM to home computers. A second major development occurred as the internet also became widely available in homes, with reference works becoming available online as well. The conversion of previously print-only reference materials to electronic format marked a major change to the marketing and accessibility of such works. A striking case study is that of the venerable Encyclopædia Britannica, which was previously only available at prices of USD 1500 and higher, restricting it to the better libraries and the wealthy. Today, the Encyclopædia Britannica and World Book Encyclopedia retail in electronic format for around 50 USD, with cheaper OEM versions sometimes bundled with new computers. Such dramatic changes brought conventionally restricted knowledge repositories to the fingertips of an almost universal audience in a period of less than 11 years. The opportunities brought by new media enticed new competitors into the reference software market. One of the earliest and most well-known was Microsoft Encarta, first introduced on CD-ROM and then also moving online along with other major reference works. In the dictionaries market, one of the more prolific brands was Merriam-Webster, which released CD-ROM and then online versions of English dictionaries, thesauri and foreign language dictionaries. Since 2010, reference materials have begun to appear as apps on Smartphones. In the field of English as a foreign or second language, this is seen as an interesting pedagogical development and is the subject of much discussion [1], as language learners increasingly abandon print dictionaries for online editions and apps like the one produced by Macmillan Education[2]. A list of online dictionaries is maintained under \"dictionaries\". Wikipedia and its offspins (such as Wiktionary) marked a new departure in educational reference software. Previous encyclopedias and dictionaries had compiled their contents on the basis of invited and closed teams of specialists. The Wiki concept allowed anyone and everyone to join in creating and editing an online set of reference works.\n",

It has led to the development and evolution of web-based communities, hosted services, and web applications. Examples include social-networking sites, video-sharing sites, wikis, blogs, mashups and folksonomies. Social networking emerged in the early 21st century as a popular social communication, largely replacing much of the function of email, message boards and instant messaging services. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are all major examples of social websites that gained widespread popularity. The information distribution continued into the early 21st century with mobile interaction and Internet access growing massively in the early 21st century. By the 2010s, a majority of people in the developed world had Internet access and a majority of people worldwide had a mobile phone.[29] Marking the rise of mobile computing, worldwide sales of personal computers fall 14% during the first quarter of 2013. The Semantic Web (dubbed, \"Web 3.0\") begins the inclusion of semantic content in web pages, converting the current web dominated by unstructured and semi-structured documents into a \"web of data\".\n",

Soon after, the core developers (Bruce Markham, William Lahti, Sander van Rossen, and Mircea-Cristian Racasan) decided that they would design their own ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler to allow the operating system to run its boot sequence without using another programming language. Once the AOT compiler was developed enough, the team then began to code the kernel. This was met with long periods of inactivity and few active developers due to lack of interest in unsafe kernel programming.[8] On 1 January 2008, the SharpOS team made their first milestone release public,[2] this is the first version of the software to appear in the SharpOS SourceForge package repository available for general public use.[9]\n",

Bethesda claimed that Interplay had only licensed the Fallout name to use for their game and could not use any of its assets. Interplay counteracted this claim by stating that they did not license the name to make an online poker game titled Fallout. They stated that what Bethesda was claiming was comparable to having a Snow White movie and the princess not appearing in it at all.[4] Interplay further stated that if Bethesda refuses to let them complete Fallout Online, then they will be able to release only one more Fallout IP with its DLCs before the rights revert to Interplay, a notion that will give Interplay the full rights to Fallout Online and the rest of the Fallout series. Interplay won the injunction resulting in Bethesda calling for an appeal.[5] It was then revealed that prior to April 9, 2009 Interplay had employed game designers, writers, and artists who had substantially completed the Fallout Online game design, including an online wiki dedicated to the game's development, which when printed and produced to Bethesda's counsel as it existed on April 4, 2009 consisted of nearly 2,200 pages. Prior to April 4, 2009, Interplay had created substantial concept art, solidified its technology plan by licensing a game engine and development tools set from Masthead Studios that would have cost Interplay millions of dollars to develop from scratch. A playable game space also existed, based on Interplay's concept art and developed by Masthead and multiple users from Europe and the U.S. could log into and interact within the game. For the game, Masthead was tasked with  revising and improving its technology, including its game engine, tools and network software.[6] On December 10, 2009 the court denied Bethesda's request for preliminary injunction. Interplay was able to continue development on the project until the case was resolved.\n",

The team also felt that new players would be alienated if Origins' story arc continued in the sequel.[26] Laidlaw added that unlike Mass Effect, Dragon Age is more about the place and the setting than the characters.[23] According to Gaider, the game was about \"freedom versus security\", as reflected by the conflicts between the mages and the Templars.[38] The game had 103 minutes of cutscenes, and nearly half a million lines of dialogue.[39]\n",

Wikis are sometimes used in classrooms for collaborative projects. Some teachers have found, however, that learners prefer to add their own content rather than rewrite others' work, perhaps because of an institutionally cultivated norm of individual ownership.[2][3] Some students express shyness about exposing their work to be viewed by others.

As of August 2016[update] the pursuit of HP(49) concerns the factorization of a 251-digit composite factor of HP49(119) after a break was achieved on 3 December 2014 with the calculation of HP49(117).[1]  This followed the factorization of HP49(110) on 8 September 2012[2] and of HP49(104) on 11 January 2011, and prior calculations extending for the larger part of a decade that made extensive use of computational resources.

      "It has been argued that pathfinders do not take a user-centred approach.[19]  Inconsistent formatting and overly-complex language have also been pointed to as being key points to watch out for.[32] Some students become frustrated with dead links on subject guides, or the omission of resources that they consider essential.  Maintaining and updating pathfinders is considered problematic.  The use of Web 2.0 tools such as wikis and blogs are considered to be helpful in enabling smaller libraries to quickly update their pathfinders.[5] Additionally, automatically checking web links to see if they are still working may be useful.[33] Individual librarians may consider themselves to \"own\" particular subject guides, rather than seeing a subject guide as one part of the institution's suite of subject guides.[34]  It has also been said that librarians take a compilatory rather than a research attitude to creating a pathfinder.[35]  Little study has been done on how well a pathfinder covers its subject matter.  A study found that pathfinders did not show the multi-disciplinary nature of literary studies well.[36]  Jackson and Pellack examined similar subject guides at different institutions to find out about duplication of effort in pathfinders.  They found that there was little overlap between subject guides at different institutions, and that some websites used were of questionable quality.  Furthermore, they found that libraries did not typically delete outdated pathfinders, because \"something was better than nothing\".[30] When academic libraries' subject guides are reviewed, they are mainly reviewed by the original authors.[37]  When pathfinders at the course level are created, it may cause confusion to the students if the teacher also creates their own resources list, or faculty may regard the librarian as overstepping their role.[38] It has been recommended to involve faculty in the creation and promotion of library subject guides.[39]  While the literature on pathfinders regularly discusses pathfinders' potential as a pedagogical tool, often the focus of the literature is shifted to merely optimising the form of the pathfinder.[40]\n",

The project does not provide complete kits—builders must procure their own parts to populate a board.  Support is purely on a volunteer basis through a Google Group and Wiki.  Software is open source and freely available for download from the Wiki.

He originally programmed it in C# using the Microsoft XNA framework, but later migrated to MonoGame in 2021, which, according to Barone, \"futureproofs the game and allows mods to access more than 4 gigs of RAM\".[15]\n",

The attack was carefully planned; the first known penetration of the network was on January 23, 2015.[42] The attackers then carried out reconnaissance of TV5Monde to understand the way in which it broadcast its signals, and constructed bespoke malicious software to corrupt and destroy the Internet-connected hardware that controlled the TV station's operations, such as the encoder systems. They used seven different points of entry, not all part of TV5Monde or even in France—one was a company based in the Netherlands that supplied the remote controlled cameras used in TV5's studios.[42] Between February 16 and March 25 the attackers collected data on TV5 internal platforms, including its IT Internal Wiki, and verified that login credentials were still valid.[42] During the attack, the hackers ran a series of commands extracted from TACACS logs to erase the firmware from switches and routers.[42]\n",

However, he did want the backgrounds and environments to be more detailed than is traditional for prime time animation,[30] reflecting the designs of the Next Generation era of Star Trek for the series' sets, starships, cinematography, and character movements.[38] The team tried to follow the same rules that would apply to a live-action Star Trek series that was set in 2380,[30] and used the wiki encyclopedia Memory Alpha as well as other fan resources to ensure they were staying accurate to the original designs of the era. The animators also watched episodes of The Next Generation while they were working on the series,[38] which uses the same blue font as The Next Generation for its credits.[30] The opening title sequence features the Cerritos flying through Next Generation-like situations with a sweeping musical score, but with twists such as it being sucked into a vortex or immediately turning around after arriving at a battle.[39] The uniforms worn by the crew of the Cerritos are based on unused designs for the film Star Trek Generations (1994).[15]\n",

A dedicated wiki, titled \"CWCki\" based on the artist's initials, was created by people who felt that the Encyclopedia Dramatica entry was not detailed or accurate enough.[2] Kiwi Farms was originally called \"CWCki Forums\"[23] before \"Kiwi Farms\" was coined in 2014.[2] It now hosts threads targeting many individuals, including minorities, women, LGBT people, neurodivergent people, people considered by Kiwi Farms users to be mentally ill or sexually deviant, feminists, journalists, Internet celebrities, video game or comics hobbyists, and far-right personalities.[2][3][7]\n",

As a devoutly religious and church-going man, his faith was intended to serve as a contrast to Homer's lack of religious sophistication. However, over the course of the show's run, Flanders was simplified into a religious fundamentalist whose Christianity was his primary defining characteristic.[6]\n",

A single open-ended prompt written by the creator of the survey determines the topic the questions should be on. The first known implementation of a wiki survey was in 2010,[4] and they have been used since then for a variety of purposes such as facilitating deliberative democracy, crowdsourcing opinions from experts and figuring out common beliefs on a given topic.[5][6][7] A notable usage of wiki surveys is in Taiwan's government system, where citizens can participate in crowdsourced lawmaking through Polis wiki surveys.[8][9][10]\n",

While software may be designed to achieve closer social ties or specific deliverables, it is hard to support collaboration without also enabling relationships to form, and hard to support a social interaction without some kind of shared co-authored works.[citation needed]\n",

Nonbenzodiazepines are similar in action to benzodiazepines, and exercise can help improve sleep. White noise is also a promising treatment for insomnia.\n",
      "cluster 3: Cluster 3 focuses on the pharmacodynamics of various drugs, including viloxazine, Adderall, MEAI, glycine receptor, and cocaine. Research has found that the pharmacodynamics of these drugs are more complex than previously assumed, and involve the complex relationships of neurotransmitters. Viloxazine has significant affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors, and acts as an antagonist and agonist of these receptors, respectively. Adderall is a combination drug composed of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, and is used in the treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy. MEAI belongs to the indane family of molecules and has been studied for its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and metabolism. Glycine receptors are composed of five subunits surrounding a central pore, and the adult form of the receptor is the heteromeric α1β receptor. Cocaine binds tightly at the dopamine transporter, blocking its reuptake function and resulting in an accumulation of dopamine in the synaptic cleft.\n",
