      "Text: Technology forecasters and researchers disagree regarding when, or whether, human intelligence will likely be surpassed. Some argue that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that bypass human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence.[22][23] A number of futures studies scenarios combine these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to interface with computers, or upload their minds to computers, in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification. The book The Age of Em by Robin Hanson describes a hypothetical future scenario in which human brains are scanned and digitized, creating \"uploads\" or digital versions of human consciousness. In this future, the development of these uploads may precede or coincide with the emergence of superintelligent artificial intelligence.[24]\n",

However, Spooner points out that the window, which is made of security glass, could not have been broken by the elderly Lanning, and hypothesizes a robot was responsible and may still be in the lab. Suddenly, an NS-5 robot, USR's latest model, attacks them before being apprehended by the police. The robot, Sonny, is a specially built NS-5 with higher-grade materials as well as a secondary processing system that allows him to ignore the Three Laws. Sonny also appears to show emotion and claims to have \"dreams\". During Spooner's further investigations, he is attacked by a USR demolition robot and two truckloads of hostile NS-5 robots, but when he cannot produce evidence to support either attack, Spooner's boss, Lieutenant Bergin, removes him from active duty, considering him mentally unstable.\n",

Most missions have several primary objectives, which usually must be completed sequentially, and often one or more secondary objectives. Secondary objectives are not necessary to complete the mission, but they do reward the player with troops or resources if completed. The game features thirteen missions (a four-mission campaign for the Mongols, a five-mission campaign for the Russians, and a four-mission campaign for the Crusaders).[5] The campaigns are independent of one another, and can be played in any order.

In numerous interviews by Black Cactus employees,[11][12] it was revealed that Battles was to put greater emphasis on quality of the artificial intelligence to allow it to match and even at times surpass human players thus creating the feeling players are playing against human opponent, making the focus of the game more multiplayer based, such as AI probing defences and using both brute force and stealth when required rather than reported \"cheating\" or \"over weakness\" in the last game. Being more of a drastic update/remake of the last game than a fully-fledged sequel, the graphics engine was updated along with new units and features such as the Arch Druid unit and extended abilities.[12] Valhalla and AI general editor mode were also new additions to take advantage of the improved AI. Due to the differences in the campaign being less about the plot, senior AI designer Mike West said this was because it would have meant simply \"crowbarring\" the plot in, and instead said it would be more like Civilization where the plot is seen to create itself.[11]\n",

      "        \"content\": \"==Understanding Essence in Philosophy and Metaphysics==\\n\\nThe concept of essence has been a central topic in philosophical discourse since ancient times. [[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]] explores the role of essence in the dialectic method of human thought, suggesting that thinking and being are equivalent, and hence, logic and metaphysics are equivalent as well. Similarly, [[Existence precedes essence]] highlights existentialism's view on essence, emphasizing that while essence is fundamental to the understanding of a thing, it is devoid of any inherent identity. This identity, according to existentialists, must be created by the individual.\\n\\nAristotelianism, represented in [[Distinction (philosophy)]] ties the distinction between essence and existence to the actuality and potentiality of a thing. Essence is essentially the potential aspect of a thing while its existence is the actuality. On the contrary, [[Essentialism]] interprets essence as an unalterable, eternal attribute present in every possible world. Opponents of this view like Karl Marx argue for the primacy of existence over essence.\\n\\n[[Definitions of knowledge]], in examining essential features of knowledge, touch on the essence or basic structure of knowledge. In [[Letter on Humanism]], existentialism's approach to the relationship between existence and essence is discussed in terms of its impact on metaphysics, illustrating the influence of essence on the interpretation of reality. Exploring Plato's belief in the distinction between knowledge derived from sensation and that conceived from timeless forms or essences, [[Platonic epistemology]] brings to light different understandings of the concept of essence.\\n\\n==Role of Essence in Different Philosophical Traditions==\\n\\n[[Aristotle for Everybody]] provides a succinct starting point for the exploration of essence in various philosophical traditions, focusing on the dissimilarity between essence and accident. [[Supernatural]], summarizing nature's operation, explains that the essence of a thing, sometimes referred as quiddity, is central to determining what the thing is, even in the case of noncorporeal entities.\\n\\n[[Index of metaphysics articles]] and [[Natural philosophy]] continue the discussion on essence by the exposition of different aspects of nature, illustrating that the essence of a thing leads to a better understanding of its nature. The dichotomy between essence and accident is also highlighted in [[Romance copula]], using the example of language to show how essence and state are reflected in semantics, while [[Antonio Escohotado]] indicates the crucial role essence plays in providing a foundation for the understanding of other concepts.\\n\\nThe principle of essence is also discussed within a religious context. [[Thomism]] interprets essence as that which makes an object what it is, differentiating between essence (quiddity) and existence (esse). [[Thomism]], while acknowledging God's essence as uncreated and eternal, also implies that a being's essence includes its existence.\\n\\n==Essence in Christian Theology== \\n\\nThe idea of essence plays a significant role in Christian theology as well. [[Godhead in Christianity]] describes Godhead as the essence of God, comprising the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Similarly, [[Attributes of God in Christianity]] considers God's essence in terms of entitative attributes, asserting that God's essence and existence coincides.\\n\\n[[Apophatic theology]], prevalent in Orthodox Christianity, asserts that God's essence is completely unknowable, and humans can only achieve an incomplete knowledge of God by reflecting upon His attributes. The concept of God being imperceptible and not apprehendable by human intellect comes from [[Gregory of Nyssa]]'s idea of God as infinite.\\n\\nSimilarly, [[Latin Church]]'s concept of Actus purus presents God as absolute perfection, with His attributes being identical with His essence. In contrast to these views, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] believes that the essence of each divine person in the Trinity is uncreated and eternal, yet distinct from each other. Central to Christianity's understanding of the spiritual journey is the doctrine of theosis from [[Sanctification in Christianity]], where humans partake in divine properties, suggesting a form of participation in the essence of God.\\n\\n==Essence in Buddhist Philosophy==\\n\\nIn Buddhist philosophy, the concept of essence is interpreted in a unique way. [[Mahayana]] Buddhism views the idea of all phenomena having \\\"no essential unchanging core\\\" and thus lack an essence or inherent nature, alluding to a metaphysical approach rather than a substance-based one. Buddhist philosophy also asserts that dharmas (transient phenomena or impermanent events) do not contain an intrinsic nature or svabh\\u0101va, which contradicts the steadfastness of essence seen in many spiritual philosophies.\\n\\nIn [[M\\u016blamadhyamakak\\u0101rik\\u0101]], essence is discussed in line with the anti-essential doctrine. Similarly, Buddhists believe that people are devoid of any eternal self or soul, a view diverging from theories positing an eternal, unchanging essence within individuals. This is highlighted in the Buddha's teachings, characterized by the doctrine of anatta or non-self.\\n\\nConversely, the [[Prajnaparamita]] or the Transcendent Knowledge scriptures of Mah\\u0101y\\u0101na Buddhism associate essence with emptiness or the illusory nature of things. As represented in [[Madhyamaka]] or the Middle Way philosophy, 'emptiness' or \\u015b\\u016bnyat\\u0101 is central to the idea that all phenomena are empty of essence or intrinsic nature (svabh\\u0101va). \\n\\nScholars of the Vaibh\\u0101\\u1e63ika school, represented in [[Svabhava]], perceive dharmas as having a constant inherent nature (svabh\\u0101va) and an unchangeable unique mark (svalaksana), which differentiates a dharma and makes it unchangeable throughout its existence. The divergent interpretations of essence in different Buddhist schools underscore the multifaceted nature of this concept across various philosophical contexts.\",\n",
